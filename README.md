# 📦 Cargo Route Profitability & Demand Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the **Cargo Route Profitability & Demand Analysis** project — an interactive analytics dashboard built with **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Streamlit**, designed to provide deep insights into global air cargo traffic based on U.S. DOT **T-100 Segment Data**.

This tool transforms thousands of flight records into a powerful visual and tabular interface for exploring airline operations, cargo volumes, aircraft utilization, and route profitability across dozens of major cargo carriers.

## ✈️ What This Dashboard Does

This project enables users to:

- 🔍 **Search** individual flight data by year, airline, aircraft model/variant, region, city, or airport  
- 📊 **Summarize** performance metrics like total freight, mail, and flight operations by airline or airline group  
- 📈 **Visualize trends** over time: growth, aircraft efficiency, regional patterns, and more  
- 💻 **Run custom SQL queries** directly on the dataset  
- 🧠 **Explore preset queries and graphs** for quick access to valuable insights  
- 🛠️ **Filter and order results dynamically** — great for both aviation analysts and data enthusiasts

## 📁 Data Source

All data is derived from the [U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/) — specifically the **T-100 Segment (All Carriers)** dataset. This includes monthly operational records of U.S. and foreign carriers operating in U.S. airspace.

Additional mapping and enrichment is performed through a custom `AIRCRAFT_VARIANTS.csv` file, which links raw aircraft codes to real-world aircraft variants, airline names, and parent airline groups.
